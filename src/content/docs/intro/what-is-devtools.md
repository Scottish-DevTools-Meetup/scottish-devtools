Welcome to **DevTools Scotland** — a place for developers, builders, and toolmakers to share, learn, and shape the future of how we build software.

We're here to:

- Demystify modern tooling for developers across the stack.
- Provide real-world workshops and code-first meet-ups.
- Share open-source tools, cheat sheets, and documentation.
- Create a living hub of DevTools knowledge, from CI to testing to AI tooling.

We believe the future of DevTools is community-led, open, and relentlessly practical.
