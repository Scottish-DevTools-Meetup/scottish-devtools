title: What is DevTools Scotland?
description: An overview of our purpose and the community we’re building.
---

Welcome to **DevTools Scotland** — a place for developers, builders, and toolmakers to share, learn, and shape the future of how we build software.

We're here to:

- Demystify modern tooling for developers across the stack.
- Provide real-world workshops and code-first meet-ups.
- Share open-source tools, cheat sheets, and documentation.
- Create a living hub of DevTools knowledge, from CI to testing to AI tooling.

We believe the future of DevTools is community-led, open, and relentlessly practical.

## Meetups as Learning Experiences

DevTools Scotland meetups are designed not just as talks, but as hands-on learning opportunities. We treat every event like a mini-course — something you actively participate in, not just watch.

Each session aims to include:

- 🧪 A practical walkthrough or live demo
- 🧰 A working repo or example project
- 🧵 Time to experiment during the session
- 🤝 Community collaboration and discussion

Bring your laptop and curiosity — these aren’t passive lectures. You’ll often leave with something running on your machine, a new repo in your GitHub, or a deeper understanding of how modern DevTools actually work.

Where possible, we capture recordings, share walkthroughs, and publish the code and assets after each event. The goal is to build a living archive of practical, Scotland-grown DevTools content — something new folks can learn from and experienced builders can contribute to.

And because learning doesn’t stop at the end of a meetup, we’re turning these into content packs: Markdown guides, screencasts, cheatsheets, and runnable code you can revisit or remix.

Think of DevTools Scotland as an open-source learning loop: we teach, share, refine, and build together.

## Innovative Learning Formats

To keep meetups dynamic and engaging, we’re exploring a range of learning formats that go beyond the standard talk:

- **👥 Pair programming demos:** Two people share a screen or stage — one as expert, one as beginner — to walk through a problem collaboratively. This format reveals the thought process and decision-making behind tool usage in real time.

- **🛠 Live debugging walkthroughs:** We break something on purpose (or not!) and work through the fix together. It’s an open window into how DevTools are used in real-world troubleshooting, and lets attendees race to diagnose the issue themselves.

- **🔧 "Bring your own config" clinics:** Attendees bring specific problems — maybe a broken Dockerfile or flaky test suite — and we work through one or two live, using group knowledge to solve them. These are always popular and deeply useful.

- **📦 Tools-in-practice tutorials:** Every tool-focused meetup should leave behind a takeaway — a GitHub repo, a walkthrough guide, a video. The goal is to build a lasting library of practical, community-built resources.

These formats keep things practical, relatable, and fun — and ensure every meetup produces value that lasts long after the evening ends.
