title: Our Vision
description: Why DevTools Scotland exists and what we're building together.
---

We started DevTools Scotland to create the kind of developer community we always wanted — collaborative, hands-on, and generous with knowledge.

We believe:

- The best way to learn is by building.
- Developer tooling should be accessible to all.
- Local communities matter in a global dev world.

Let’s make software better, together.
