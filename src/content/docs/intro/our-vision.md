title: Our Vision
description: Why DevTools Scotland exists and what we're building together.
---

We started DevTools Scotland to create the kind of developer community we always wanted — collaborative, hands-on, and generous with knowledge.

We believe:

- The best way to learn is by building.
- Developer tooling should be accessible to all.
- Local communities matter in a global dev world.

Let’s make software better, together.

## What Makes a Great DevTools Meetup?

We want DevTools Scotland to be more than a series of talks. We want to create an environment where developers feel engaged, energised, and part of something useful. That means:

- **Hands-on sessions:** From live coding to debugging walk-throughs and "bring your own config" clinics — we believe people learn best by doing.
- **Interactive formats:** Whether it's lightning talks, group discussions, or Q&A panels, our events are designed to be participatory.
- **Real-world relevance:** We focus on tools that developers actually use — CI/CD, observability, security, docs, AI-assisted workflows — and the problems they solve day to day.
- **Show and tell moments:** Everyone has something to share. We love giving attendees a chance to present their own tips, tools, or war stories.
- **Friendly and welcoming:** Whether it’s your first meetup or your 50th, you should feel part of the community. That means a Code of Conduct, inclusive vibes, and probably pizza.
- **Knowledge that persists:** We aim to capture and publish everything we can — talk recordings, example code, slides, cheat sheets — so the value of the night lives on long after the lights go out.

We’re building a shared knowledge hub, one meetup at a time. If you want to learn, teach, share, or just geek out — there’s a place for you here.

## Environment, Vibe, and Lasting Value

We believe great meetups are as much about energy and atmosphere as they are about code. That’s why every DevTools Scotland event is built to feel welcoming, relaxed, and a little bit fun.

We prioritise:
- A friendly MC to set the tone and make newcomers feel welcome.
- Clear adherence to a Code of Conduct, so everyone feels safe and included.
- Space for informal chats and networking — often over pizza, snacks, or a drink.
- A sense of humour, a bit of personality, and maybe even a themed night or trivia round to keep things engaging.
- Swag. Always swag. Stickers and t-shirts are more than merch — they’re memory markers.

Beyond the event, we’re building a **community resource library** that lives online and grows over time:

- A curated list of tools and DevTools resources contributed by the community.
- Meetup summaries and recordings so no one misses out.
- Slides, demo code, and GitHub repos from sessions to try things at your own pace.
- Cheat sheets and mini-guides for the tools we cover.
- A place to ask questions and share knowledge — whether that’s Discord, Slack, or a shared doc full of “how we solved it” moments.

It’s all part of our goal to create a DevTools hub that’s practical, participatory, and rooted in the Scottish tech community.
