## First Meetup: Tuesday 14th October @ CodeBase Edinburgh
We’re launching a new meetup series for developers who want to get hands-on with tools, workflows, and code that actually solve problems. This isn’t another tech talk. It’s a builder’s meetup — and we’re starting strong.

🗓️ **When:** Tuesday 14th October, 6:30–8:00pm  
📍 **Where:** CodeBase, Edinburgh\
👉 [RSVP via Luma](https://luma.com/ufzmw4p6)\
🍕 And yes, there’ll be pizza.\
🧠 Curiosity essential.

🛠 Our first session is all about PGVector + Supabase — and how you can use them to build a fast, fuzzy book search app using real vector embeddings.
We’ll show:
*	How to generate embeddings from book titles and descriptions
*	How to store and query those embeddings using PGVector inside Supabase
*	How it compares to keyword search and when it’s worth the switch
*	A walkthrough of the full repo with live querying and result previews

You’ll leave with a working knowledge of vectors in PostgreSQL and how to plug that into your own projects — no ML background needed.

⚠️ **Don’t forget your laptop:** this isn’t a passive talk. You’ll be writing code, running queries, and building as we go.\
🧰 **Before you arrive:**
To get the most out of the session, please make sure you’ve:
*	Created a free account at Supabase
*	Installed a code editor like VS Code
*	Pulled the starter repo (we’ll share the link soon)
*	Got PostgreSQL basics in your brain (don’t worry — we’ll keep it friendly)

We’ll be writing code, querying vectors, and exploring Supabase live.
